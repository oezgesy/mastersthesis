Miuccia Prada chose a new approach, eschewing fashion in favor of timeless style, while Gucci's Alessandro Michele made a controversial statement with a series of straitjackets. But in the end, it was Donatella Versace who won the week with her Friday night slot.;0
Revisiting one of her own most significant fashion contributions, Versace had J.Lo ignite the runway in a remake of the jungle green dress the singer wore to the 2000 Grammys.;0
At the time, so many people searched images of the garment that Google was inspired to create Google Image Search.;0
"At the end of her show, which riffed heavily off the green palm print so synonymous with that gown, Versace's voice came over the sound system: ""OK Google, now show me the real jungle dress.""";0
On cue, J.Lo herself emerged onto the runway in a new version of the dress and once again sent the social-media into meltdown.;0
Elsewhere, several other designers exhibited their Spring-Summer 2020 collections in venues that also showcased Milan's stunning architecture.;0
When it's fashion month, models usually have castings and fittings the whole day -- a lot of running around! It honestly changes everyday so there's not a routine that we can follow during that time, but a cup of coffee in the morning is something that I never forget.;0
Food is so important -- you have to be energized to go to all of your appointments. I want to feel great so I never skip meals even if my day is very busy. Staying hydrated is also very important!;0
There are so many good places in Paris. My favorites are probably Toraya for a good Japanese set lunch or sweet treat and Freddy's, a really nice wine and food place with tapas-like dishes that you can share with a friend. The place is pretty small but the food is very good.;0
Fairytale dresses -- complete with flowing chiffon and layers of tulle -- were also out in number, from actress Brittany Snow in J. Mendel to singer Halsey's strapless pink gown.;0
"With ""Game of Thrones"" leading nominations on the night, the series' stars were among some of the night's most talked-about. In particular, Emilia Clarke wowed in a plunging Valentino number.";0
Scrum is an agile process framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, research and advanced technologies.;0
It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed stand-up meetings, called daily scrums.;0
Scrum is a lightweight, iterative and incremental framework for managing complex work.;0
The framework challenges assumptions of the traditional, sequential approach to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved.;0
The Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex product, such as software, that weren’t based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.;0
"In the early 1990s, Ken Schwaber used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna implemented the first Scrum team at Easel Corporation in 1993 benchmarking it with tools from Capers Jones company, Software Productivity Reeearh. By 1995 they had demonstrated performance at 10 times the average waterfall productivity in Capers Jones productivity books.";0
Communication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.;0
Empathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have—the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs.;0
A product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.;0
The team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.;0
Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.;0
"A sprint (also known as iteration or timebox) is the basic unit of development in Scrum. The sprint is a timeboxed effort; that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.";0
Each sprint starts with a sprint planning event that establishes a sprint goal and the required product backlog items. The team accepts what they agree is ready and translate this into a sprint backlog, with a breakdown of the work required and an estimated forecast for the sprint goal. Each sprint ends with a sprint review and sprint retrospective, that reviews progress to show to stakeholders and identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints.;0
Scrum emphasizes valuable, useful output at the end of the sprint that is really done. In the case of software, this likely includes that the software has been fully integrated, tested and documented, and is potentially releasable.;0
"At the end of a sprint, the team holds two events: the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.

At the sprint review, the team:

reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed
presents the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. the demo)
collaborates with the stakeholders on what to work on next
Guidelines for sprint reviews:

Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated.
The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint-durations).";0
"Guidelines for sprint retrospectives:

Three main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?
The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))
This event is facilitated by the scrum master";0
Backlog refinement (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.;0
The product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.;0
"The product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery.";0
Story points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant.;0
Scrum is a feedback-driven empirical approach which is, like all empirical process control, underpinned by the three pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.;0
Scrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and Kanban. Scrumban is especially suited for product maintenance with frequent and unexpected work items, such as production defects or programming errors.;0
In commerce, user experience (UX) is a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership.;0
Many factors can influence a user's experience with a system. To address the variety, factors influencing user experience have been classified into three main categories: user's state and previous experience, system properties, and the usage context (situation).;0
One branch in user experience research focuses on emotions. This includes momentary experiences during interaction: designing affective interaction and evaluating emotions. Another branch is interested in understanding the long-term relation between user experience and product appreciation.;0
Machine learning (ML) is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.;0
"Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.";0
Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.;0
Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers.;0
The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.;0
Data mining is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning.;0
In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.;0
In supervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs.;0
Semi-supervised learning algorithms develop mathematical models from incomplete training data, where a portion of the sample input doesn't have labels.;0
Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values. For a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.;0
Regression algorithms are named for their continuous outputs, meaning they may have any value within a range. Examples of a continuous value are the temperature, length, or price of an object.;0
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm builds a mathematical model from a set of data which contains only inputs and no desired output labels. Unsupervised learning algorithms are used to find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points. Unsupervised learning can discover patterns in the data, and can group the inputs into categories, as in feature learning.;0
In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans.;0
"Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of ""intelligent agents"": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.";0
"Colloquially, the term ""artificial intelligence"" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic ""cognitive"" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as ""learning"" and ""problem solving"".";0
"Analytical AI has only characteristics consistent with cognitive intelligence; generating a cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions.";0
The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner.;0
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems.;0
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.;0
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.;0
"The history of natural language processing (NLP) generally started in the 1950s, although work can be found from earlier periods. In 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence.";0
"The machine-learning paradigm calls instead for using statistical inference to automatically learn such rules through the analysis of large corpora of typical real-world examples (a corpus (plural, ""corpora"") is a set of documents, possibly with human or computer annotations).";0
